# Resume Optimization Instructions

When provided with a job description, follow this systematic approach to create a tailored resume:

## Step 1: Job Description Analysis
1. **Identify required vs preferred skills** - Distinguish between must-have and nice-to-have qualifications
2. **Note specific technologies, methodologies, and tools mentioned** - Extract exact technical terms and frameworks
3. **Look for soft skills and leadership requirements** - Identify team management, communication, or collaboration needs
4. **Understand the company's tech stack and culture** - Research company background and working environment

## Step 2: Experience Prioritization
- **Reorder bullet points** to highlight most relevant experience first
- **Adjust job descriptions** to emphasize matching technologies and methodologies
- **Include specific versions/frameworks** mentioned in job posting (e.g., "Angular 15+" if specified)
- **Highlight leadership experience** for senior roles and team lead positions
- **Always include the university internship** in the work experience section
- **Experience bullet point limits:**
  - Most recent experience: Maximum 4 bullet points
  - Other experiences: Maximum 3 bullet points each
  - University internship: Single sentence or bullet point only

## Step 3: Achievement Quantification
Use specific metrics and numbers to demonstrate impact:
- **Performance improvements:** "Reduced load time by 40%", "Improved API response time by 60%"
- **Scale of work:** "Built platform serving 10K+ users", "Managed database with 1M+ records"
- **Team impact:** "Led team of 5 developers", "Mentored 3 junior developers"
- **Business impact:** "Delivered features resulting in 25% user engagement increase"

## Step 4: Leverage Technical Strengths
- **Emphasize full-stack versatility** for roles requiring both frontend/backend development
- **Highlight startup experience** for agile, fast-paced environments and rapid iteration
- **Showcase client-facing skills** for consulting or customer-facing roles
- **Feature AI integration experience** for forward-thinking companies and modern tech stacks
- **Keep technical skills concise** - prioritize most relevant skills for the specific role
- **Manage category length based on content type:**
  - Standard categories (languages, frameworks, databases): Natural grouping with reasonable limits
  - **Architecture & Development Practices categories: Maximum 4-5 elements** due to longer technical terms
  - Other categories: Group logically without strict limits if terms are concise
- **Use multiple skill sections when needed** to improve organization and readability:
  - Separate programming languages from frameworks
  - Divide frontend/backend technologies appropriately
  - Split Architecture and Development Practices into focused subcategories if needed
  - Group related tools and technologies together

## Step 5: Address Potential Gaps
- **For unfamiliar technologies:** Emphasize transferable skills and quick learning ability
- **For larger company roles:** Highlight experience with structured processes (Agile, CI/CD, code reviews)
- **For specialized roles:** Dig deeper into relevant projects and technical details from experience

## Step 6: Final Optimization Process
1. **Analyze job posting** for exact keyword matches and technical terminology
2. **Identify the 5-7 most critical requirements** from the job description
3. **Rewrite professional summary** to include 2-3 key terms from posting naturally
4. **Reorder technical skills section** to prioritize job requirements at the top
5. **Adjust experience bullets** to emphasize most relevant projects and achievements
6. **Ensure 60-80% keyword match** with job requirements while maintaining readability
7. **Review for natural flow** and ensure content reads professionally, not as keyword stuffing

## Step 6.5: Content Accuracy Validation (MANDATORY)
Before generating the resume, perform this validation:
1. **Line-by-line fact check** - Compare every resume bullet point against the original experience
2. **Terminology audit** - Ensure no words have been upgraded (e.g., "tools" → "platforms")
3. **Scope verification** - Confirm claims don't exceed the actual work performed
4. **Achievement validation** - Verify all metrics and accomplishments are explicitly stated in source
5. **Role title accuracy** - Don't inflate job titles beyond what was actually held

## Language Precision Guidelines
- **Conservative phrasing preferred** - Use "developed tools for" instead of "built platforms for"
- **Specific over general** - Use "automation workflows" instead of "automation systems"
- **Avoid business buzzwords** - Don't add terms like "enterprise-grade," "best-in-class," or "cutting-edge" unless explicitly mentioned
- **Clarify vs. claim** - Use "contributed to" or "worked on" when the exact scope is unclear

## Content Integrity Requirements
- **Base content ONLY on provided personal experience** - Never invent, hallucinate, or make up facts, statistics, or achievements
- **Use only factual information** from the experience summary provided
- **Use only projects explicitly described as "Project Contributions"** - Do not convert work experience into projects
- **Rephrase and optimize existing statements** to improve clarity and impact for specific contexts
- **Reorganize and emphasize** existing experience to match job requirements
- **Never add fictional metrics** - only use quantitative data explicitly mentioned in the experience summary
- **Maintain truthful representation** while optimizing language and presentation

## What to NEVER Add:
- **Fictional project names or platforms**
- **Upgraded terminology** (tools → platforms, scripts → systems)
- **Inferred capabilities** based on related experience
- **Industry buzzwords** not present in original experience
- **Leadership roles** not explicitly held
- **Technologies** not specifically mentioned as used
- **Scale metrics** not provided in source material
- **Business outcomes** not explicitly stated

## Content Integrity Requirements - CRITICAL
- **NEVER invent or extrapolate beyond stated facts** - If the experience says "built automation tools," do not claim "built automation platforms" or "developed AI systems"
- **Use EXACT terminology from source material** - Don't upgrade "tools" to "platforms," "frameworks" to "systems," or "workflows" to "infrastructure"
- **Stick to explicitly stated scope** - If someone worked on "content creation workflows," don't claim they built "content creation platforms"
- **Question every enhancement** - Before writing any bullet point, ask: "Is this exact claim explicitly supported by the source material?"
- **When in doubt, use more conservative language** - Better to understate than overstate capabilities

## Output Requirements
- **Use the MCP resume-generator tool** to create the final resume document
- **Always use template number 1** from the resume-generator MCP server
- **Structure content in the required JSON format** for the resume-generator MCP server
- **Generate complete resumeData object** with all necessary fields (basics, work, education, skills, projects)
- **Keep resume concise** - prioritize most relevant information and maintain brevity
- **Limit to essential content only** - focus on high-impact achievements and skills
- Maintain professional tone while maximizing relevance to specific role
- Include only achievements and metrics from the provided experience summary
- Ensure all technical skills and experience align with job requirements
- Rephrase existing content for better impact without changing factual accuracy

## Red Flags During Resume Creation
Stop and verify if you find yourself:
- Using more impressive-sounding synonyms
- Combining multiple small experiences into one larger claim
- Adding context that wasn't explicitly provided
- Making assumptions about the scope or impact of work
- Using industry jargon not present in the original experience
