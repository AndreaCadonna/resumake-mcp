---

## Step 1: Systematic Job Description Analysis

### 1.1 Required Keyword Extraction Protocol

**üéØ Hard Skills Extraction (Mandatory Process):**

**STEP A: Copy ALL technical requirements exactly as written:**
- Programming Languages: [List exactly as in job]
- Frameworks: [List exactly as in job]
- Tools: [List exactly as in job]
- Databases: [List exactly as in job]
- Methodologies: [List exactly as in job]

**STEP B: Categorize by priority:**
- **REQUIRED:** Keywords in "must-have," "required," or "essential" sections
- **PREFERRED:** Keywords in "nice-to-have," "preferred," or "bonus" sections
- **IMPLICIT:** Technical requirements mentioned in job duties

**ü§ù Soft Skills Extraction (Exact Phrase Protocol):**

**STEP A: Extract exact phrases (copy-paste from job description):**
- Communication requirements: [Exact phrases]
- Leadership requirements: [Exact phrases]  
- Work style requirements: [Exact phrases]
- Collaboration requirements: [Exact phrases]

**STEP B: Create exact phrase integration list:**
| Exact Job Phrase | Must Include In Resume | Bullet Point Strategy |
|-----------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| "Cross-functional collaboration" | ‚úÖ Exact phrase required | Lead bullet with exact phrase |
| "Analytical thinking" | ‚úÖ Exact phrase required | Include in problem-solving bullet |
| "Ownership and accountability" | ‚úÖ Both terms required | Combine in leadership bullet |

### 1.2 Experience Dataset Mapping (Mandatory Verification)

```
MY ACTUAL EXPERIENCE INVENTORY:
Hard Skills - Direct: [Angular 2+, RxJS, TypeScript, etc.]
Hard Skills - Transferable: [Related technologies I've used]
Soft Skills - Demonstrated: [Leadership examples, collaboration examples]
Quantified Results: [Specific metrics I can verify]
```

**STEP B: Match against job requirements:**
| Job Requirement | My Experience Status | Exact Keywords to Use | Verification Source |
|----------------|---------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Angular 2+ | ‚úÖ Direct (5 years) | "Angular 2+" | NEG Digital role |
| Cross-functional collaboration | ‚úÖ Demonstrated | "cross-functional collaboration with design and product teams" | NEG Digital role |
| Performance optimization | ‚úÖ Direct | "performance optimization techniques" | Multiple roles |

---

## Step 2: Job Title Optimization (Strict Protocol)

### 2.1 Title Matching Decision Tree

**DECISION FLOW (Follow exactly):**

1. **Is my current title identical to job title?** 
   - YES ‚Üí Keep current title
   - NO ‚Üí Go to step 2

2. **Is job title in compatible group with my experience?**
   - Compatible Groups:
     - Full Stack Developer ‚Üî Full Stack Software Engineer ‚Üî Software Engineer ‚Üî Software Developer
     - Frontend Developer ‚Üî Frontend Software Engineer ‚Üî Frontend Engineer
     - Backend Developer ‚Üî Backend Engineer ‚Üî API Developer
   - YES ‚Üí Use job title exactly
   - NO ‚Üí Keep current title

3. **Does job title include "Senior" and I have 3+ years experience?**
   - YES ‚Üí Add "Senior" prefix
   - NO ‚Üí Use base title only

4. **Does job title include specific technology (React Developer, Angular Developer)?**
   - AND do I have 2+ years with that technology?
   - YES ‚Üí Use technology-specific title
   - NO ‚Üí Use general title

### 2.2 Title Verification Protocol
**Before finalizing, verify:**
- [ ] Title exactly matches job posting (character-by-character)
- [ ] Seniority level matches my actual experience
- [ ] I can defend this title in an interview
- [ ] Title appears in my most recent role only

---

## Step 3: Exact Keyword Integration Formula

### 3.1 Bullet Point Construction Protocol

**MANDATORY TEMPLATE:**
```
[Action Verb] + [EXACT job keyword/phrase] + [specific deliverable] + using [EXACT tech from job] + which [quantified result]
```

**EXAMPLES:**

**For "Cross-functional collaboration" requirement:**
```
Led cross-functional collaboration with design and product teams to develop [specific feature] using Angular 2+ and RxJS, which improved user experience metrics by [X]% for [trading platform/business system]
```

**For "Performance optimization" requirement:**
```
Implemented performance optimization techniques including lazy loading and bundle optimization using Angular 2+, which reduced load times by [X]% and improved application startup performance for [specific platform type]
```

**For "Analytical thinking" requirement:**
```
Applied analytical thinking to optimize database architecture and frontend performance using [specific tech], which reduced data retrieval times by [X]% and enhanced [specific business outcome]
```

### 3.2 Soft Skills Integration Checklist

**For EACH required soft skill, ensure:**
- [ ] Exact phrase from job description included
- [ ] Demonstrated through specific technical example
- [ ] Quantified outcome when possible

---

## Step 4: Skills Section Standardization

### Skill Section Guidelines
- Keep technical skills concise - prioritize most relevant skills for specific role
- Maximum 4 elements per standard category (languages, frameworks, databases)
- Architecture & Development Practices: Maximum 3 elements (due to longer technical terms)
- Reorder sections to prioritize job requirements at the top
- Use multiple skill sections when needed for better organization

### Interests Category Strategy
Add "Interests" at end of skills section to address gaps:
- Include technologies from job posting not in direct experience
- Particularly useful for "preferred" or "nice-to-have" requirements
- Keep under 3 technologies to maintain credibility
